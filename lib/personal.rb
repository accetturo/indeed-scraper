"To Whom it may concern,

With my skill set and experience, I believe I would make a great addition to the #{self.company} team. I have experience with multiple web technologies, including Ruby on Rails, Javascript, React.js, PostgreSQL, responsive frameworks like Bootstrap and Semantic UI, and behavior driven development frameworks like Jasmine and RSpec. I have built a number of passion projects using these technologies, including www.brokeflix.com, a free streaming movie aggregator that makes it easy to find quality free movies online. The app was built using Ruby on Rails 5 api mode backend, and a React.js frontend configured with Webpack.

Whether itâ€™s a team project or my personal website (www.tomyancey.me), I always insist on a high level of quality and stability.

For all of the reasons above, I believe I would make a great addition to your team. I have attached my resume for your consideration and look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,
Thomas Yancey"
